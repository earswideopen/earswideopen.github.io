            <p>According to several <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/407128/apple-wireless-earpods-hearing-aids/">articles</a> on the web, Apple is going to ship new
wireless (including noise cancellation) earpods with the next Iphone 7. The
potential shape seems very close to the <abbr title="Behind The Ear">BTE</abbr> hearing systems
quite common on the actual market.</p>

<p>The author of the article seems to draw some tough conclusions regarding the
actual market of hearing aids by stating that they are overpriced, difficult to
use and think that Apple could be disruptive in the domain. I wouldn't argue
with the first arguments but when we look at Apple history, the company doesn't
usually try to open the market. On the contrary, it tends to close it by
creating a golden case around the user in order to use only Apple's products
and depose a lot of patents to avoid or at minimum slow down competition. While
I was looking for information about Apple and hearing aids I came accross an
older <a href="http://blog.hackandhear.com/?p=203">post from Helga Velroyen</a> (from Hack and Hear website) who had
similar thoughts back in 2012.  It's always good thing to have more choice and
the arrival of Apple on this sector could stimulate the other manufacturers to
be more creative and have more robust algorithms.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
