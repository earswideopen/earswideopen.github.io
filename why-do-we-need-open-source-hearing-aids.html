            <p>THIS IS A DRAFT</p>
<p>Since few month, I'm interesting in hearing impairements and more specifically
in hearing aids systems. When discussion around me comes about this project,
two main legitimate questions arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's wrong with the current systems available on the market</li>
<li>Why open source is so important</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are at the foundation of this project and need to be explained
a bit more in details.</p>
<h2>What's wrong with the current systems on the market</h2>
<ul>
<li>signal processing that could be improved</li>
<li>no control over your system</li>
<li>poor choice</li>
<li>social system not active</li>
</ul>
<p>My first answer is "nothing is wrong with the actual on the market". Clearly
manufacturers work hard and tends slowly to adapt their hardware to the
technologies of today. Each company has between 20 and 200 engineers,
researchers, technicians, audiologist and so on, therefore the price you pay
can be understandable. Nevertheless, each product has its weaknesses and can be
improved in several ways.</p>
<p>Of course, if I was thinking that everything is perfect, I won't think that an
open source hearing aid would be beneficial for some users. When I digged a bit
on that subject, I found a very interesting talk from Brian Moore intitulated
<a href="www.thebsa.org.uk/lunchlearn/improvements-hearing-aids/">improvements in hearing aids</a>. The talk is now about 3 years old but the
conclusions drawn are still valid (improvements on current signal processing,
accurate performance measurements of an hearing aid, ...). In other words,
there is plenty of room for an open source project to be beneficial on the
matter. I invite you to watch the video (unfortunately, no transcription of the
video is available at the moment).</p>
<p>These issues are met by any manufacturer open source or not. Nevertheless, the
purpose of every compagny is to be profitable and by doing so, she needs to
attract new clients and keep the old one. In order to do so, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be the only one on the market or have few competitors</li>
<li>have a good product experience</li>
<li>have a close system to avoid the client to switch easily to a competitor product.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a choice from the start, nothing is wrong with it as long as you have
choices. This is one of the other purpose of the project: having the choice!
It could sound painful by doing so, but having a different philosophical,
technical approach can lead to very interesting outcomes, I just hope, it will
happen here.</p>
<p>Another thing worth to be mentionned even if it's not related to the
manufacturers is the social system in most of countries in Europe consider
hearing aids as a system for comfort<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> only (like for glasses) even if for
the vast majority of people seeing and hearing "well" is more than a conmfort
but a necessity. Because the prices of most hearing aids are really expensive
(depending of the type of impairement you will pay between 300 and 3500 euros).
This make the access of this system really difficult for most of people.</p>
<p>Usually when you enter into the audioprothesist shop, you'll have the choice
between a very <strong>poor range of products</strong> and it will change from one
audiologist to another. This is not the fault of the audiologists who have to
make a drastic choice as they have to learn for each product how to calibrate
it for the patient.</p>
<h2>Why the open source is so important</h2>
<p>Here, I'm going to describe the possible advantages that opening the sources of
the project can bring.</p>
<p>First it can be obvious but it doesn't usually works like this in private
compagnies, the potential users can take a complete part during all the life of
the system, from the specifications to the use of the system. If you succeed by
<strong>including the users</strong> all along the project, you increase the chances to get
a product corresponding to the majority of your users.
Having <strong>open specifications</strong> let everyone what is going on and choose the
system based on all parameters.
If there is a conflict inside the project or if the project stops, anyone can
reuse the code (according to the license) in order to fork, improve, change to
suit his needs. If a compagny close down, in the vast majority of cases, all
information disapear with it. By opening the code and specifications you
<strong>diminished the obsolescence</strong>. In the industry of hearing aids, the normal
cycle of a product is that you won't have any updates of your system once it
has been bought. Maybe there is a good reason to do so even if I don't see it
but because everything is nowadays accessible remotely, any system should be
<strong>updated</strong> regularly for at minimum reduces security holes. Having an open
source project let as well anyone <strong>audit the code</strong> or hardware
specifications, potentially ensuring that the system won't do anything not
wanted (sending sensible information for example) or just discover or fix bugs.</p>
<p>Some work can be inspiring such as <a href="http://bioaid.org.uk/">BioAid</a> project developped at the
University of Sussex but unfortunately stopped in 2013.</p>
<ul>
<li>open specifications</li>
<li>potential direct link between the users and developpers</li>
<li>interoperability with other equipment</li>
<li>larger and better audit of the code and hardware</li>
<li>obsolescence diminished</li>
<li>update of the code</li>
<li>security regarding remote access of the device</li>
<li>control of the system by the user</li>
</ul>
